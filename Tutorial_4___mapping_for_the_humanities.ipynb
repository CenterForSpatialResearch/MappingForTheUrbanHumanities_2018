New York has an incredible number and variety of second language speakers, yet how and where they are used - in a spoken format - remains less charted, especially on a spatial level. \n",
        "\n",
        "The questions we will be probing include: are there spatial patterns to where speakers of certain languages live within the city? And, drawing on a unique dataset of institutions where a language other than English is expected or formalized, how do these formal and semi-formal spaces map spatially across the city? How do they intersect, if at all, with places of residence? In the next tutorial (5), geoprocessing tools will help formalize these analyses.\n",

This makes the most sense if you have a theory of something meaningful behind different levels- e.g. if we had a study suggesting that more than 700 speakers in a neighborhood is a threshold for children to retain more of their second language. \n",

Sometimes Q maps even a single variable in a 'noisy' way; this is particularly true when our geographic unit is something that isn't particularly meaningful to our story (Who cares or knows about tracts, anyways?!).

It is in no way complete or representative - there are many spaces where meaningful language exchanges regularly take place but that are too hard to map- and other places may be over-represented. What the dataset does do, however, is map the electronically 'visible' institutions where second language usage is publicized and where entry is relatively open to the public.\n",
